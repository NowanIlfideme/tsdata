# `tsdata`: Time Series Datasets in Python

This repository is a collection of time series datasets.

The `tsdata` package itself contains a way of loading these into Pandas.

**NOTE**: The PyPI name is `py-tsdata` due to confict with a removed package.

**NOTE**: This package currently only includes the bare requirements.
However, I will keep adding data and functionality over time.

## Installing

You can install this as a regular Python package via pip:

```sh
pip install py-tsdata
```

## Quickstart

Currently there is no data here... but here is how you would run it:

```python
import tsdata

print(tsdata.__version__)
```

## Contributing

If you have time series datasets you would like to add (that you have the rights
to contibute), please create a pull request!
